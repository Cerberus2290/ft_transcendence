Collecting test cases:
- stuff evaluation was the easiest one - Guillaume did not wanna break the code. He only tests, what's on the eval sheet and the modules. We wants to check that we understand the project.
  -> Guillaume asks in the beginning who did which tasks of the code and asks everyone due to that questions!

- frontend container for responsive design? (desktop + mobile)

- checking docker logs from all containers + error notifications that maybe not appear in front end.
- having developer console from browser open in front end (to check f.e. if back end does not reply, permission denied, ...) NO ERROR should pop up here
- Testing chat functions (User invites other user, User changes user rights and change also from other users, block other users, combinations of everything, ...)
