Collecting test cases:
- stuff evaluation was the easiest one - Guillaume did not wanna break the code. He only tests, what's on the eval sheet and the modules. We wants to check that we understand the project.
  -> Guillaume asks in the beginning who did which tasks of the code and asks everyone due to that questions!

- frontend container for responsive design? (desktop + mobile) Frameworks are available (f.e. react, tailwind css)

- checking docker logs from all containers + error notifications that maybe not appear in front end.
- having developer console from browser open in front end (to check f.e. if back end does not reply, permission denied, ...) NO ERROR should pop up here
- Testing chat functions (User invites other user, User changes user rights and change also from other users, block other users, combinations of everything, ...)

- authorising with 42, and then click "no I don't want" --> what's the behavior?
- registration credentials not saved proper, cannot be used for login (check docker logs)
- login via 42 intra does not work
- .env file needs to be created manually and not in repo!!! (for eval)
